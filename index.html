        <a id="United_Center"><h2>United Center</h2></a>
        <p>Located in the near west side of the city, the United Center is home to two of Chicago's favorite sports teams: the Chicago Bulls
        and the Chicago Blackhawks. It replaced the old Chicago Stadium, which was nicknamed “The Madhouse on Madison.” The sports at the
        United Center are taken very seriously by Chicagoans. In fact, the roof of the United Center building was designed to amplify instead
        of diminishing “the roar,” the noise made famous by Blackhawks fans at the previous arena. In addition, it took two years for the new
        Allen organ to recreate the notes the previous organ produced. Accessibility and fan enjoyment are important features of the 960,000
        square foot building, which also hosts concerts and other entertainment. The United Center is an important part of the culture and
        history of the city.</p>
